          Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a
          self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground
          fighting, and submission holds. BJJ approaches self-defense by
          emphasizing taking an opponent to the ground, gaining a dominant
          position, and using a number of techniques to force them into
          submission via joint locks or chokeholds. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was
          initially developed in 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo,
          Gastão Jr., O’Brien, and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught
          jiu-jitsu by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917.
          Later on, the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system,
          and published Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. BJJ eventually came to be its own
          defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and
          adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and Judo, and became an essential
          martial art for modern MMA. BJJ revolves around the concept that a
          smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a
          bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight
          distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of
          holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for
          sport grappling and self-defense situations. Sparring, commonly
          referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community, and live drilling
          plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ
          can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building
          character, and as a way of life.

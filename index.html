          style="width: 400px; text-align: justify" ;> Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ;
          Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a self-defence martial art and
          combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting, and submission
          holds. BJJ approaches self-defense by emphasizing taking an opponent
          to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of
          techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or
          chokeholds. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was initially developed in 1925 by
          Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., O’Brien, and Hélio
          Gracie, after Carlos was taught jiu-jitsu by a travelling Japanese
          judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later on, the Gracie family developed
          their own self-defense system, and published Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. BJJ
          eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the
          innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and Judo,
          and became an essential martial art for modern MMA. BJJ revolves
          around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully
          defend themselves against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by
          using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground
          and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ
          training can be used for sport grappling and self-defense situations.
          Sparring, commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community,
          and live drilling plays a major role in training and the
          practitioner's development. BJJ can also be used as a method of
          promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.
